# Arpeggio Accompanier
## Final Project for Music 158A

The Arpeggio Accompanier is a tool which can accompany musicians with arrpegios in real time in the correct key. 

## How to Use
When you open the file, you will be presented with a display like so: 
<img width="882" alt="image" src="https://github.com/aidenm1/ArpeggioAccompanier/assets/65800707/b29f6ac3-0ede-4218-b1d0-f15c25b4d24b">

First, load in four different sounds of your choosing. The sound must be a sustained C4 note. You may use the sample sounds included in the repository.

Then, enable the adc and see if the microphone is receiving input and displaying the correct note. Adjust the input gain as necessary.

Then, select which chords you would like to use to accompany in real time. 

Then, adjust the output gain, press clear, and start playing!

## Note
This program works best with instruments that produce a long sustained sound which is in tune. Thus, instruments like violin, trumpet, etc. work best with this program. 
You may encounter issues using a piano or voice due to the nature of these instruments.
